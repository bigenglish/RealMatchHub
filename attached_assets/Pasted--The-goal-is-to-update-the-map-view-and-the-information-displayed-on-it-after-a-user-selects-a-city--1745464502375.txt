"The goal is to update the map view and the information displayed on it after a user selects a city on the landing page and completes the neighborhood questionnaire. Here's how to integrate this functionality in the Replit backend (Node.js/Express.js) and how the data should be structured for the WordPress frontend:"

Backend Logic (Replit):

Receive City Selection and Questionnaire Data:

Create a new API endpoint (e.g., /api/neighborhoods/personalized) that accepts the selected city (e.g., "Los Angeles") and the user's responses to the neighborhood questionnaire as parameters in the request (likely as a JSON object in the request body).
Retrieve Relevant Neighborhood Data:

Based on the selected city, query your Firebase database or the third-party neighborhood data APIs you've integrated to retrieve the geographical boundaries (e.g., GeoJSON polygons) and associated data for the neighborhoods within that city.
Calculate Personalized Neighborhood Scores/Indicators:

For each neighborhood within the selected city, calculate scores or indicators based on the user's questionnaire responses and the available neighborhood data. This will involve:
Accessing User Preferences: Retrieve the user's answers from the request body.
Applying Weights: Use the importance ratings (scale of 1-5) provided by the user to weight the different neighborhood characteristics.
Data Mapping: Map the user's preferences to the data points you have for each neighborhood (e.g., user preference for "walkability" maps to the density of relevant POIs in the neighborhood).
Score Calculation: Develop a scoring mechanism (you'll need to define the exact formulas) to generate a numerical score for each neighborhood based on how well it aligns with the user's overall preferences and individual criteria.
Augment Neighborhood Data with Scores and Relevant POIs:

Structure the data you send to the frontend to include:
Neighborhood Boundaries: GeoJSON data for drawing the neighborhood polygons on the map.
Personalized Scores: The calculated score for each neighborhood based on the user's questionnaire.
Relevant Points of Interest (POIs): Filter and include POIs (parks, restaurants, schools, etc.) within each neighborhood that are highly relevant to the user's top preferences (based on their questionnaire answers). For example, if the user highly values "parks," include park locations within the neighborhood data.
Send Data to Frontend:

Send this augmented neighborhood data as a JSON response to the WordPress frontend. The structure might look something like this:
