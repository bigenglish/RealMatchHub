1. Address the WebSocket Errors:

Locate WebSocket Initialization Code: Search the frontend codebase (likely in JavaScript files within a src or public directory) for the code that initializes the WebSocket connection. Look for instances of new WebSocket(...).
Identify the Source of undefined: Examine how the WebSocket URL (wss://localhost:undefined/?token=...) is being constructed. Trace the value of the variable that should be providing the WebSocket server address or endpoint. Determine why this variable is becoming undefined.
Correct the WebSocket URL: Ensure that the WebSocket URL is being built correctly with the proper hostname (not localhost unless that's the intended server) and a valid path or endpoint, including the token parameter. The undefined part needs to be replaced with the correct value.
Test WebSocket Connection: After fixing the URL construction, verify that the frontend can successfully establish a WebSocket connection to the intended server. Monitor the browser's Network tab (under the "WS" filter) for a successful connection (status 101 Switching Protocols).
2. Investigate the Missing IDX Broker Listings (Focus on /idx-data):

Open the Relevant Frontend Code: Locate the JavaScript code that runs when the "Direct Data Endpoint" page is loaded and makes the fetch request to /idx-data. This code is likely within the IDX Data Viewer component or a similar file.
Examine the fetch Request: Ensure the fetch request is correctly constructed and sent to the /idx-data endpoint on your Replit backend.
Inspect the Backend /idx-data Route (as per previous instructions):
Verify that the backend route is correctly making requests to the IDX Broker API (using the correct API key, headers, and endpoint).
Check for any errors occurring in the backend during the API request or data processing. Log the raw data received from the IDX Broker API on the backend to inspect its structure.
Ensure the backend is sending a valid and correctly formatted response (ideally JSON) back to the frontend.
Examine Frontend Data Handling: Review how the frontend code (in the IDX Data Viewer component) is handling the response from the /idx-data endpoint.
Check if it's correctly parsing the JSON response (if that's the expected format).
Verify that the code is correctly extracting the listing data from the response.
Ensure there is logic to dynamically render the listing data into the HTML of the component.
Debug Rendering Logic: If the frontend is receiving data but not displaying it, carefully examine the part of the code responsible for rendering the listings. Look for any errors in how the data is being used to create the HTML elements.
Debugging Steps:

Add Logging: Add detailed logging on both the frontend (to see the response from /idx-data) and the backend (to track the API request and response).
Use Browser Developer Tools: Utilize the Network tab to inspect the /idx-data request and its response (status code, headers, body). Use the Console tab to look for any JavaScript errors occurring during the data processing or rendering on the frontend.
Test Backend Endpoint Directly (Optional): You can use tools like curl or Postman to send a GET request directly to your Replit backend's /idx-data endpoint to inspect the raw response without the frontend involved. This can help isolate backend issues.
