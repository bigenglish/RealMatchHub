Explanation for Replit Agent Implementation:

initiate_service_request Function:

This function will be triggered when a user confirms their service selection and preferred time.
It takes the user_id, service_type, property_zip_code, preferred_date, and preferred_time as input.
It performs the core matching logic:
Finds potential providers based on service_type and property_zip_code.
Filters them by preferred_date and preferred_time (you'll need to implement a more robust availability check against provider schedules).
Sorts the available providers (you can add criteria like ratings, distance, etc.).
Selects the best match.
Creates a record of the service request in your database with a pending_acceptance status.
Sends email and SMS/push notifications to the matched service provider with the request details.
Sends email and SMS/push notifications to the user confirming their request has been sent.
Replace the placeholder functions (e.g., get_user_details, find_providers, send_email_notification_to_provider) with your actual database interaction logic and notification sending mechanisms.
handle_provider_acceptance Function:

This function will be triggered when a service provider accepts or rejects a service request (likely through a dashboard you'll need to build for them).
It takes the service_request_id, provider_id, and a boolean accepted as input.
It verifies the request and provider.
If accepted:
Updates the service request status to accepted.
Retrieves user and provider contact details.
Sends email and SMS/push notifications to the user informing them of the acceptance and providing provider contact information.
If rejected:
Updates the service request status to rejected.
You might want to trigger a re-matching process here or notify the user that their request was rejected.
Replace the placeholder functions (e.g., get_service_request_details, update_service_request_status, send_email_notification_to_user) with your actual database interaction and notification logic
