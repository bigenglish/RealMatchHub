Investigate the /idx-data Backend Route:

Locate the code in the backend of this Replit project that handles the GET request to the /idx-data endpoint. This file might be named server.js, index.js, app.js, or a similar name, and it should contain the route definitions.
Carefully examine the code within this route handler. Look for any potential sources of errors, including:
IDX Broker API Request Logic: Verify that the code is correctly making requests to the IDX Broker API. Double-check the API endpoint URLs, required headers (especially the accesskey), and any parameters being sent.
Error Handling: Look for try...catch blocks and ensure that errors during the API request or data processing are being handled correctly and logged. If there's an error, the route should send an appropriate error response (e.g., a 500 status with an error message) back to the frontend.
Data Processing: If the code processes the data received from the IDX Broker API before sending it to the frontend, review this processing logic for any potential errors (e.g., accessing undefined properties, incorrect data transformations).
Database Interactions (If Any): If this route interacts with a database, ensure those operations are error-free.
Examine Server Logs: Check the Replit console output for any error messages or stack traces that might have been logged when the /idx-data endpoint was accessed and returned a 500 error. These logs can provide valuable clues about the exact line of code causing the issue.
Identify and Eliminate Unintended jgidx.js Involvement:

Review the frontend code for the "API-Based Implementation" page (likely a JavaScript file associated with that page).
Search for any instances where the jgidx.js file (the IDX Broker widget script) is being loaded or executed. This could be through <script> tags in the HTML or dynamic script loading in the JavaScript.
If the goal is a pure API-based implementation, remove any code that directly loads or uses the jgidx.js widget script on this page. The frontend should be responsible for rendering the raw data fetched from your /idx-data endpoint, not relying on the widget's rendering logic.
Ensure Frontend Data Fetching and Rendering:

Examine the JavaScript code on the "API-Based Implementation" page that makes the fetch request to /idx-data.
Verify that this code correctly handles the JSON response from the backend.
Ensure that there is logic in the frontend JavaScript to take the raw listing data received from /idx-data and dynamically generate the HTML to display it on the page.
Debugging Steps:

Add Detailed Logging: Add more logging statements in both the backend (/idx-data route) and the frontend JavaScript to track the flow of data and identify where errors might be occurring. Log the raw data received from the IDX Broker API in the backend to inspect its structure.
Use Browser Developer Tools: Utilize the browser's Developer Tools (Network tab to see the /idx-data request and its response, Console tab for JavaScript errors) to observe the communication between the frontend and backend.
