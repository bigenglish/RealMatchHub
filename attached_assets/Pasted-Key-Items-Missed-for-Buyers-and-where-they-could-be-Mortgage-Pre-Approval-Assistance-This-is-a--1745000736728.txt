Key Items Missed for Buyers (and where they could be):

Mortgage Pre-Approval Assistance: This is a critical early step for serious buyers. Could be a feature in the FREE tier (linking to resources or partners) or a more integrated tool in the BASIC tier.
Home Inspection Coordination: Streamlining the often stressful inspection process would be valuable. Could be a BASIC tier feature.
Closing Assistance/Guidance: Similar to the document review, providing support through the closing process would be beneficial. Could be a BASIC tier enhancement.
Property Viewing Scheduling Tool: While mentioned in the FREE tier, a more robust and integrated scheduling tool could be highlighted.
