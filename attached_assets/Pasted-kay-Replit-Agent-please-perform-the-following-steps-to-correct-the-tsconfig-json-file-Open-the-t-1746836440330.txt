kay, Replit Agent, please perform the following steps to correct the tsconfig.json file:

Open the tsconfig.json file located at the root of your project.

Examine the entire content of the file carefully. You will likely find two separate blocks of JSON code, each starting and ending with curly braces {}.

Identify the intended configuration settings. Determine which of these JSON objects represents the correct TypeScript compiler options, include, and exclude settings for your project. It's possible they were accidentally concatenated or pasted together.

Merge the contents into a single, valid JSON object. You need to have only one top-level set of curly braces {} encompassing all the configuration options. For example, if you have:

JSON

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ... options 1
  },
  "include": [
    // ... include 1
  ]
}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ... options 2
  },
  "exclude": [
    // ... exclude 2
  ]
}
You need to combine them into one like this (carefully merging the relevant options):

JSON

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ... options 1
    // ... potentially merge options 2 if they are different and valid together
  },
  "include": [
    // ... include 1
    // ... potentially merge include 2 if needed
  ],
  "exclude": [
    // ... exclude 2
    // ... potentially merge exclude 1 if needed
  ]
  // ... any other top-level configurations
}
Be very careful when merging to avoid duplicate keys or incorrect syntax. If you're unsure which set of options is correct, you might need to review your project's documentation or your intended TypeScript compilation settings.

Remove the extraneous JSON object. Ensure there is only one top-level JSON object in the tsconfig.json file.

Save the tsconfig.json file.

After saving, attempt to deploy the Repl again.

The error message "Expected end of file in JSON but found "{"" strongly suggests that the JSON parser encountered the beginning of a second JSON object before the first one was properly closed. Fixing the multiple JSON objects issue in tsconfig.json should resolve this build error and allow the deployment to proceed.
